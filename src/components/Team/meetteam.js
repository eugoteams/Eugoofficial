                    Meghana aravi is an Ex-Google and Ex-Facebook Software
                    Engineer who runs a YouTube channel with over 200k
                    subscribers. After graduating with a degree in Mathematics
                    from the University of Pennsylvania in May 2016, he decided
                    to learn programming and to enroll in Fullstack Academy, an
                    immersive coding bootcamp in New York City. While there, he
                    fell in love with full-stack development and algorithm
                    analysis. Upon completion of the program, he dove deeper
                    into the field of algorithms and aced the Google interviews.
                    The frustration that he felt during his interview prep led
                    him to creating AlgoExpert. He used AlgoExpert to prepare
                    for the Facebook interviews; unsurprisingly, he aced them!
